								<p>
								Hanshi (Honorable Master) Steve Arneil was born in South Africa in 1934.  At the age of 10, his family moved to 
								Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), and there he began training in Judo and boxing.  His mother made him stop boxing, 
								but he continued studying Judo.
								</p>
								<p>
								From an early age, Hanshi Arneil was fascinated with the Orient, and he began watching a Chinese man practicing 
								Shorin (Shaolin) Kempo in the man's back yard.  The Chinese man noticed Arneil "spying" on him, and invited him 
								to train.  Arneil accepted the offer and trained with his new friend throughout his school years and college.
								</p>
								<p>
								Around the age of 25, Hanshi Arneil moved to Durban, South Africa, to complete his education in mechanical 
								engineering.  He found a local Judo dojo in Durban that also offered karate.  At the time, a number of Japanese 
								people were emigrating to South Africa, arriving at the port city of Durban.  Arneil would go to the arriving 
								ships and ask if any of the Japanese practiced karate.  If so, he would invite them to train at the dojo.  
								These men practiced various karate styles, but Arneil didn't care about the differences – to him, karate was karate.
