								Sōsai 総裁 (President) Masutatsu Oyama, the founder of Kyokushin Karate, was born in southern Korea in 1923.
								While living at his sister's farm in Manchuria at the age of nine, he began his lifelong journey along the 
								Martial Way when he began studying the southern Chinese form of kempo know as "Eighteen Hands".  When Mas 
								Oyama returned to Korea at the age of 12, he continued his training in Korean kempo.
								</p>
								<p>
								In 1938, at the age of 15, Mas Oyama moved to Japan to train as an aviator, and continued his martial arts 
								training by participating in judo and boxing.  Shortly afterwards, he began training at the dojo of Gichin
								Funakoshi, who had brought karate from Okinawa to Japan and developed what is now known as Shotokan Karate. 
								Mas Oyama's training progressed so rapidly that by the age of 17, he was a Nidan 二段 (2nd Dan), and by the
								age of 20, he was a Yondan 四段 (4th Dan) in Shōtōkan 松濤館流.  At this point, Mas Oyama took a serious 
								interest in Jūdō 柔道, and in less than four years he achieved the rank of Yondan in Judo as well.
								</p>
								<p>
								After the end of World War II, Mas Oyama began training under Nei-Chu So, one of the highest authorities in 
								Japan of Gōjū Ryū 剛柔流, an Okinawan karate style.  Master So, renowned for the power of his body as well 
								as his spiritual insight, encouraged Mas Oyama to dedicate his life to Budō 武道, the Martial Way.  He 
								suggested that Mas Oyama retreat from civilization for three years to train his mind and body without the 
								distractions of the outside world.
