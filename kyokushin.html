								<h1> Budo Karate  武道空手 </h1>
							</div>
								<p>
								What is Kyokushin karate?  To some, it is a way to develop and maintain physical strength and learn effective self-defense techniques.  To others, it is much more than that.  Kyokushin karate is a way of life that transcends the physical aspects of training.  Kyokushin karate is Budō Karate 武道空手.
								</p>
								<p>
								The philosophy of Budo is evident in the name that Mas Oyama chose for his karate style, Kyokushin 極真, which means "Ultimate Truth".  It is also reflected in the Training Hall Oath (Dōjō Kun 道場訓), in Mas Oyama's Eleven Mottos (Zayū no Mei Jūichi Kajō 座右の銘十一個条), and in the Spirit of Osu (Osu no Seishin 押忍の精神).
								</p>
								<p>
								The essence of Budo Karate cannot readily be depicted by reading a few paragraphs; Budomust be experienced.  However, one can get a glimpse of its meaning by looking at the origin of the martial arts and its relationship with Eastern philosophies, and by examining the words "Karate" and "Budo" themselves.
								</p>
								<p>
								Kyokushin karate, like most martial arts, can trace its origin to Bodhidarma (Daruma  達磨 in Japanese), an Indian prince and Buddhist priest who traveled to the Shaolin temple in China in the early sixth century.  There, he developed the Chan, or "Intuitive" school of Mahayana Buddhism.  Under the Chan philosophy, enlightenment was sought through meditation, rather than by the practice of rituals or the study of religious texts.  According to legend, Bodhidharma sat facing the wall in the Shaolin temple for nine years, until he achieved enlightenment.  (Other legends have him sitting and facing a wall in a cave for nine years.)  Bodhidharma also developed martial arts as a physical regimen to accompany the mental discipline of the meditation.  During the following centuries, the Chan (or Zen 禅 in Japanese) philosophy spread to Okinawa and then to Japan, accompanied with martial arts.  Over time, Zen and martial arts became intermingled with each other and deeply ingrained in Japanese society.
